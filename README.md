# E-commerce Back End

## Description

This is a back end application for an e-commerce site. This application used Express.js, node.js and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application displays data in the database using mySQL with models and associations. The application then uses API routes to perform RESTful CRUD operations, which you will see in the walk-through video. The application allows users to view, add, edit, and delete categories, products, and tags.

## Installation

To connect to the database run `mysql -u root -p` and enter the password in the .env file.
To seed the data run `npm run seed`.
Finally to connect to the server run `npm start`.
